# Credit-card-fraud-Detection
This project implements a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques.
It analyzes a dataset of credit card transactions to identify fraudulent activities. The system is trained on a labeled dataset (train.csv) and evaluated on a separate test dataset (test.csv) to ensure its effectiveness in detecting new, unseen fraudulent transactions.
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. By analyzing transaction data, the system identifies patterns indicative of fraud, helping to prevent financial losses for cardholders and financial institutions.
